# PowerballMarkov

I made this program shortly before the powerball reached $500M in 2017. I had been interested in the appearance
  of Markov chains in lottery drawings (using the powerball lottery as an example). The program was written to search 
  Markov chains in historical results (see .txt file included that has powerball drawing history accurate as of January 2017)
  and to apply the Markov chains to generating better powerball tickets (because everyone wants to win right?)
  
I ran the program and bought 20 real life tickets based on the tickets it produced to commit myself to the results of the 
  program($40, yikes). I won $21 on those tickets and on tickets I did not win, matched more than I had in the past on the 
  absolute random ones the lottery machines spits out. 
  
No I am not quite a millionare, but at the very least it was interesting to see the frequency of some numbers when others are
  present in the same drawing, and then the corelated most likely powerball number.
  
Feel free to compile and give it a shot for youself if you would like.
